# whisper-sandbox

This is just a sandbox for me to try out Whisper (https://openai.com/research/whisper).

**Select an mp3 file** or **paste a link to a YouTube video** with Korean or Japanese-language audio and the program will transcribe the audio into the transcription field.

(Other languages work, but aren't officially supported in this project.)

Highlight any text in the transcription field at it will be dynamically translated in the translation field below.
